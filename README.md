# Contact_management_system
Welcome to the Contact Management System project written in C++! This project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for managing your contacts efficiently.


This project uses c++ file system to store contacts permanently on system storage and are easily accesible.
You can store essential contact information, including names, phone numbers, email addresses, and more.
The project enables you to search for specific contacts based on different criteria, ensuring quick and accurate retrieval of information.
When contacts are no longer relevant, you can seamlessly delete them from the file.
